## QHack Open Hackathon

Share your ideas with the quantum world at QHack's famous open hackathon!

This year's hackathon includes new sponsored challenges, each with unique prizes. You can submit your project to multiple prizes as long as it is eligible for them.

See below for challenge topics and additional eligibility criteria. Complete details for prize eligibility is available in the [2023 QHack Terms & Conditions](https://qhack.ai/terms-and-conditions/).

---


### How do I take part?


To submit your team's entry for any of these prizes, you should follow these steps:

1. Create a repository with your project.


2. Create an issue in this repository following this [template](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack2023/issues/4).


3. If you are applying for a power-up, indicate this by adding the `PowerUp` label to the issue you created in step 2 (alternatively, type `[power-up]` at the beginning of the issue name).


4. If, on the other hand, you are submitting your work for the final project — _not_ a power-up — you must add the `Done` label to the issue created in step 2 (alternatively, `[Done]`). If you submitted your work previously for a power-up, create a new issue for your final project submission — do not reuse the power-up submission.

In the template you will be asked to add a link to your repository. In this case, instead of sending a link to the `main` branch, **you should send the link to the commit at that time**. 
Here, I share with you a gif in which we can see how to link to the last commit.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/link_commit.gif" alt="drawing" width="100%"/>
</p>

Once your screen shows the files associated with the commit, copy the link that appears above in the browser.

And that's it — as easy as that!

### What hackathon project should my team do?

Although there will be a specific set of hackathon topics, within a topic, the choice is up to you (unless the topic specifies otherwise).
You could brainstorm a new idea with your team, or start from one of the following seed ideas:

- Implement an idea from the quantum literature — or from one of our guest speaker presentations — with code.


- Create a self-contained tutorial or demonstration of an idea from quantum computing. See the [PennyLane Community page](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos_community.html) to see what we're looking for!


- Extend one of the QHack Coding Challenges in a novel or interesting way.


- Repurpose one of the [PennyLane demos](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html) to run on a quantum hardware device.


- Submit a Pull Request to an open-source library with a new feature.

All entries are subject to the QHack [Terms & Conditions](https://qhack.ai/terms-and-conditions/).

### Hackathon Prizes

#### Visualization Challenge

In this hackathon you are asked to create a program capable of automating the creation of a specific type of plot or visualization using code. These plots should illustrate a system, describe a quantum computing concept, or even generate quantum-inspired art automatically. Beyond the Bloch sphere, how can we represent more than one qubit? What about a way to visualize entanglement? Or a method to depict a qutrit? Visualization is fundamental to understand everything we do! Look for a topic and get to work!

**First Prize**:

#### Quantum Chemistry Challenge

One of the main applications of quantum computing is the calculation of the ground state energy of specific molecules. As we calculate, we always work with approximations and models that simplify the real-world system, but move us away from the empirical results obtained in the laboratory. In this hackathon we will face a molecule a bit larger than normal: $BeH_2$. Your goal will be, with the help of a quantum computational algorithm, to obtain a result as close as possible to the real ground state energy value. Not only will the obtained result be evaluated, but other parameters such as time efficiency and the cleverness of your ideas will also be taken into account.

**First Prize**:

Sponsored by:
[IBM Quantum](https://www.ibm.com/quantum) & [PINQ2](https://pinq2.com)

- Block of 10 hours access on a 127-qubit Eagle processor.

*Here are some ideas: use the Circuit Knitting Toolbox to simulate and calculate energy states of this large molecule, use the error mitigation and error suppression methods built into the Qiskit Runtime to produce high quality calculations of molecular energy states and vibrational energies.*

**Second Prize**:

Sponsored by:
[QunaSys](https://qunasys.com)

- Two on-site internship positions for one month in Tokyo (full-time). The salary will be 300,000 JPY plus flight and accommodation.
- Each team member will have the choice between either one Nintendo Switch™ Console or one set of Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones  (maximum 4 electronic items in total).

*As inspiration, you can check out [qulacs on GitHub](https://github.com/qulacs/qulacs), [QURI Parts documentation](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/), or [QURI Parts tutorials](https://quri-parts.qunasys.com/tutorials.html).*

**Third Prize**:

Sponsored by:
[qBraid](https://qbraid.com)

- Remote internship for 6 weeks with a salary of $6,000 USD (one spot).
- Up to three sets of Apple® AirPods® for team members not participating in the internship.

*This [review article on variational quantum eigensolvers for quantum chemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/arelativelye/pii/S0370157322003118) covers many new technique that still need to be implemented.If you are looking to write code for some new techniques, you will find this paper helpful. A bonus tip: there has been good progress in fermion to qubit mappings in the past year. But, which fermionic encoding is most resilient to errors in NISQ devices is still unknown. It would be wonderful if people could look into this problem. With good enough progress, this could lead to a nice paper.*

#### Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computing Challenge

As you may already know, one of the big bets in quantum is hybrid computing, in which we combine the potential of quantum and classical computers to obtain results we would not be able to achieve with classical computing alone. This field is ripe for big, bold new ideas, which is where you come in! This hackathon asks you to look for new problems to which hybrid computing could be applied, think of new, interesting QML models, push the limits of hybrid programming and show us what it can do.

**First Prize**:

Sponsored by:
[Covalent](https://www.covalent.xyz/)

- Up to four Apple Watches®

*Curious about the possibility of using both quantum and classical computing to create a time machine? Check out this [PennyLane demo](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_univariate_qvr.html) and learn how to use Covalent and Pennylane to dance between classical and quantum parts in your code.*

**Second Prize**:

Sponsored by:
[IQM](https://www.meetiqm.com)

- Collaboration between members of the winning team and IQM to support advancement of the winning team's work.
- Up to 4 tickets for [Superconducting Qubits and Algorithms Conference 2023](https://sqa-conference.org/) (in Munich). It includes a travel budget of up to €2,400 to be split among the whole team.

*We are always on the lookout for genuine hybrid algorithms that have both heavy classical and quantum loads, as examples of workflows that could make real use of a large classical computation. Typical variational algorithms tend to have very limited classical computing needs, so it would be interesting to see something that uses a VQA only as a sub-routine, or even does something completely different.*

**Third Prize**:

Sponsored by:
[QuEra](https://www.quera.com)

- Up to four reMarkable tablets with Marker and Folio
- Atomic Certificate of Victory

*Preparing large and entangled quantum states is a main challenge in quantum computing — at QuEra, we've got you covered for both! As your duty, should you choose to accept it: explore methods to optimize Hamiltonian parameters classically. For example, try to prepare a Z2 state (alternated 0101) in a line, while overcoming the limitations of adiabatic protocols. Here are a few ideas that have not yet been demonstrated with neutral atoms, but should be possible: [[1]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1619826114), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03209)*

#### QEC and Compilation Challenge

We keep hearing that quantum computers are subject to noise and that we are in the NISQ era. Even now we are still far from being able to deal well with noise, so the goal of this hackathon will be to improve our faults. Find new error correcting codes? Optimize the complication of processing certain operators? You are free to choose your own project, so long as you keep one idea in mind: facilitate the execution of quantum circuits subjected to noise as best as you can.

**First Prize**:

Sponsored by:
[Nord Quantique](https://www.nordquantique.ca)

- $5,000 USD paid one person trip to meet the Nord Quantique team and tour the ecosystem in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. 
  - Alternatively, the approximate USD $5,000 travel budget may be shared across all team members to meet the Nord Quantique team and tour the ecosystem in Sherbrooke, Quebéc, Canada. In addition, Nord Quantique pays for accommodations and meals

  *Hey hackers, Nord Quantique is proud to sponsor this Hackathon. We are excited to see how many qubits you can simulate in your numerical experiments. 👀⚛️🚀💻*

**Second Prize**:

Sponsored by:

*QAOA is a NISQ-friendly algorithm with modest resource requirements. However, when compiled for execution on a target quantum computer with limited connectivity, heavy overheads can arise due to the need for SWAP operations. Minimizing the number of these additional gates is essential to extract the best performance possible. Try designing a solution to optimize the SWAP networks specifically for QAOA circuits, making your computations more resource-effective with OpenQAOA — some ideas [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06143).*

### What are the judging criteria for ranking the Open Hackathon projects?

The QHack organizing team will grade every Open Hackathon submission based on three criteria:

- Scientific and/or technical ability demonstrated.
- Overall quality of presentation.
- Depth of use of the quantum computing software and hardware stack.

Specific Open Hackathon Challenges may be judged by that Challenge's sponsors. The QHack organizing team will provide the sponsor with a ranked list of the top candidate projects that are eligible for that Challenge. The final winner will be chosen by the sponsor from this list of top candidates.

Good luck!
