#### Analog Quantum Computing Challenge

Sponsored by [Pasqal](https://pasqal.io/)

**Awarded for**:
Best Open Hackathon project which uses analog quantum computing

**Prize**:

 *Two hours of QPU time on Pasqal's cloud platform (usable in June 2022)*

**Info:**

In contrast to the digital mode where the time evolution of qubits is described by discrete quantum gates, control over the device can be realized at the so-called analog level, where the user can directly manipulate in a continuous manner the mathematical operator (the Hamiltonian) describing the evolution of the ensemble of atoms. Not only does it allow for a finer level of control over pulses during the application of gates, but it also makes it possible to directly use the Hamiltonian of the system as a resource for computation. The fine level of control allowed by this analog setting, together with the large number of possible geometric configurations of neutral atom registers, makes it a powerful tool for quantum processing. A good starting point for analog quantum computing is the [Pulser](https://pulser.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) framework, developed by Pasqal.

#### QAOA Challenge

Sponsored by [Entropica](https://www.entropicalabs.com/)

**Awarded for**: 

Best Open Hackathon project using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm

**Prize**:

*One winner will receive a 12-week paid remote internship at Entropica Labs (2,800 SGD/2,080 USD per month); if conditions allow the internship can be done in Singapore)*.

**Info**: 

QAOA is a heuristic quantum algorithm based on the adiabatic theorem and may offer a quantum advantage for discrete optimisation in the NISQ era. However, the performance can depend strongly on the specific problem being tackled. In this challenge, you will select your favourite combinatorial optimisation problem and analyse how QAOA fares against it. Hint: You could pick bin packing, the knapsack problem, vertex cover, or maybe a scheduling problem. And there are many more! 

If you need some structure to get started, you could:

1. Pick an optimisation problem
2. Implement a QAOA workflow using a QC framework of your choice
3. Hack the day away! Experiment with different problem instances, change the meta-parameters of QAOA, experiment with different classical optimisers, and try to find the optimal solutions to the problem

In order to qualify for the internship you will need to meet the following requirements:

- Be able to commit for 12 consecutive weeks of internship before the end of 2022
- You are a full-time University student (BSc, Masters or PhD Candidate) or recently graduated (within the last 12 months)
- For the in-person internship in Singapore: To qualify for and obtain a WHP (https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-holiday-programme)

Quantum algorithms for chemistry applications are expanding. We can now calculate the ground-state energy of molecules, excited-states energy, energy derivatives, periodic systems, and so on! With quantum algorithms, we can test wide varieties of industrial applications like reaction path search, photochemical reaction, molecular dynamics, etc.

Coding tool: QunaSys will open their software product Qamuy—Gaussian-like quantum chemistry software—for all participants. You can use it to build chemistry applications easily! Of course, you are welcome to build using Pennylane, Qiskit, Cirq, etc.

### What is the judging criteria for ranking the Open Hackathon projects?

The QHack organizing team will grade every Open Hackathon submission based on three criteria:

- Scientific and/or technical ability demonstrated.
- Overall quality of presentation.
- Depth of use of the quantum computing software and hardware stack.

Specific Open Hackathon Challenges may be judged by that Challenge's sponsors. The QHack organizing team will provide the sponsor with a ranked list of the top candidate projects that are eligible for that Challenge. The final winner will be chosen by the sponsor from this list of top candidates.
