## QHack Open Hackathon

Share your ideas with the quantum world at QHack's famous open hackathon!

This year's hackathon includes new sponsored challenges, each with unique prizes. You can submit your project to multiple prizes as long as it is eligible for them.

See below for challenge topics and additional eligibility criteria. Complete details for prize eligibility is available in the [2023 QHack Terms & Conditions](https://qhack.ai/terms-and-conditions/).

### How do I take part?


To submit your team's entry for any of these prizes, you should follow these steps:

1. Create a repository with your project.


2. Create an issue in this repository following this [template](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack2023/issues/4).


3. If you are applying for a power-up, indicate this by adding the `PowerUp` label to the issue you created in step 2.


4. If, on the other hand, you are submitting your work for the final project — _not_ a power-up — you must add the `Done` label to the issue created in step 2. If you submitted your work previously for a power-up, create a new issue for your final project submission — do not reuse the power-up submission.

In the template you will be asked to add a link to your repository. In this case, instead of sending a link to the `main` branch, **you should send the link to the commit at that time**. 
Here, I share with you a gif in which we can see how to link to the last commit.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/link_commit.gif" alt="drawing" width="100%"/>
</p>

Once you are showing the files associated with the commit, copy the link that appears above in the browser.

And that's it — as easy as that!

### What hackathon project should my team do?

The QHack Open Hackathon is open-ended. The choice of topic is completely up to you! 
You could brainstorm a new idea with your team, or start from one of the following seed ideas:

- Implement an idea from the quantum literature — or from one of our guest speaker presentations — with code.


- Create a self-contained tutorial or demonstration of an idea from quantum computing. See the [PennyLane Community page](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos_community.html) to see what we're looking for!


- Extend one of the QHack Coding Challenges in a novel or interesting way.


- Repurpose one of the [PennyLane demos](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html) to run on a quantum hardware device.


- Submit a Pull Request to an open-source library with a new feature.

All entries are subject to the QHack [Terms & Conditions](https://qhack.ai/terms-and-conditions/).

### What are the judging criteria for ranking the Open Hackathon projects?

The QHack organizing team will grade every Open Hackathon submission based on three criteria:

- Scientific and/or technical ability demonstrated.
- Overall quality of presentation.
- Depth of use of the quantum computing software and hardware stack.

Specific Open Hackathon Challenges may be judged by that Challenge's sponsors. The QHack organizing team will provide the sponsor with a ranked list of the top candidate projects that are eligible for that Challenge. The final winner will be chosen by the sponsor from this list of top candidates.

Good luck!
